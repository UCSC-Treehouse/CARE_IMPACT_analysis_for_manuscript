TH34_1349_S01	compendium-v8	treehouse-protocol-12.0.0-9a30111	per https://github.com/UCSC-Treehouse/operations/issues/244#issuecomment-420378114, this output treehouse-protocol-12.0.0-9a30111 is the canonical output. it was generated with a roll up sarcoma cohort described in that comment
TH34_1349_S02	compendium-v8	treehouse-protocol-12.0.0-9a30111	per https://github.com/UCSC-Treehouse/operations/issues/244#issuecomment-420378114, this output treehouse-protocol-12.0.0-9a30111 is the canonical output. it was generated with a roll up sarcoma cohort described in that comment
TH34_1379_S01	compendium-v8	treehouse-protocol-13.0.0-874aacd.2	per https://github.com/UCSC-Treehouse/operations/issues/258, we initially used the Small Blue Cell Cohort as a comparison group, so i'm using that as the canonical output even though the later analysis comparing to Liver Tissue contributed to the analysis
TH34_1444_S01	compendium-v8	treehouse-protocol-14.0.1-765565a.1	although this protocol has a .1, it is a protocol without a custom cohort
TH34_2410_S01	compendium-v11_polya	treehouse-care-0.17.1.0-8107fe7.1	per https://github.com/UCSC-Treehouse/operations/issues/360, we initially used a uterine comparison group, so i'm using that as the canonical output even though the later analysis comparing to sarcoma contributed to the analysis
